			<text>What this trail involves
On this trail you'll explore the Library building.

 You'll need to bring your campus card so you can get in.

As you go through the trail you'll need to make some notes. You can bring pen and paper, or UEA's cloud-based tool OneNote.

Click on 'Sign in with a work or school account' and enter your UEA username and password (your username will look like 'abc15xyz@uea.ac.uk').</text>

			<text>Task 1
Find a study skills guide
Your first task on this trail is to find and borrow a study skills guide of your choice.
Take a look at this reading list containing books in the Library that can help you develop your study skills (the link should open in a new tab).
Choose one (or more if you like!) and click on the title to see a description of the book
Make a note of the 'Shelf mark' on the right-hand side of the screen
This tells you where to find the book in the Library. You'll also see this called a 'Classmark'.</text>

			<text>Task 2
Find your book
Remember you made a note of the Classmark of your book?

When you get to the Library, check the floor guides to see where to go to find that Classmark. 
You'll find a floor guide on every level in the staircases, along with a map of each floor to help you pin-point which bookshelf to aim for.
If you chose one of the books from the 'General' section of the reading list, you'll find that the Classmark begins with the letters LB - so head for Floor 2!</text>

Keep a record
Keeping an 'audit trail' of everything you read is more important than you might think. You might need to reference it in an assignment later on, or you may want to go back to ideas you learned about before. Keeping a record as you go along is much easier than trying to remember what you borrowed six weeks ago! 
Start a reference library
Pick a place to save the details of everything you read, so that all the information is kept together. This could be a notebook, a Word document, a special tab in OneNote ... anywhere you like, as long as it's easy for you to come back to it in future.</text>

Get your IT sorted
Your final task is to get all your IT needs sorted. Before you leave, stop by floor 0 of the Library and make sure you're set up for WIFI, printing and scanning.

Visit the IT Service Desk on floor 0 to get your phone or laptop set up with UEA's wifi service, Eduroam (or use this online guide).
Eduroam will help you stay connected all over the campus, and you'll be able to access password-protected library resources automatically.
IT Service Desk tick icon IT Service staff can help with all your IT-related queries: why not save their Help page?

Print, copy and scan
You can use the PrintPlus machines in the Library and ITCS building to print, photocopy, and scan. Just scan your campus card at the Print Plus machine to collect your printing, or to photocopy or scan a document.
You'll need to load credit onto your account before you start. You can do that at the pay station on floor 0 of the Library, or online. In this video, UEA student Neesh will show you how.
Top tips:
Scanning is free, so instead of printing why not email material to yourself and read it online later?
You can print from your own device as well as from UEA computers.
You can also get free printing in Union House (the Students' Union building).

In this trail you'll start exploring your subject and academic information.

You will discover:

how to find what you need to read quickly, in the Library or online
the different types of academic publication and what they can offer you
how academic language is different from everyday communication
strategies for reading and making notes efficiently - and critically</text>

			<text>Why this trail?
Studying at university involves a lot of reading - and also a lot of thinking critically about what you've read. In this trail we'll look at some of the different elements involved in reading, thinking about, and responding to texts.

Watch this video (4:11 mins) of UEA students talking about how they manage their reading. What are the key points they identify?

			<text>What this trail involves
In this trail you'll explore how to use the approaches mentioned by students in the video.

They talked about:
having to be selective, and find what's relevant for your argument
reading with a purpose
not reading every page of a book or article
using skimming and scanning techniques to read efficiently.

This trail will help you put these strategies into practice, become familiar with academic language and writing structure, and understand different types of academic publication.</text>

Explore your options
Your first task is to become familiar with three important sources that you'll use over and over again to find what to read:

your reading lists
Library Search, the library catalogue
your subject guide.

Let's look at each of these in turn.</text>

			<text>Your online reading lists
Often available online, these are generally divided up either by the weeks of your course or sometimes by subject. They contain links to the works you need to read to progress on your course - these will be marked as 'core reading' - and also to optional further reading that will help you achieve a deeper understanding of your subject.





Check if the reading lists for your first modules are available online.

If your list isn't in the online reading list system yet, you should be able to find it in your module information on Blackboard. You can then use Library Search to find the recommended books and articles - so we'll look at Library Search next.

			<text>Library search
You can find all the textbooks, journals and other academic materials on your reading lists in UEA's library catalogue, Library Search. 
Many of our books and articles are available online, so you don't have to come to the library building to read them. Those that we have in print are arranged in the Library by their classmarks - codes that show the book's subject area (such as LC67.6 WIL in the image above).

You can find out how the classmark system works in the Library Trail.

Watch the videos showing you how to find your reading quickly on Library Search.

			<text>Your subject guide
Your online subject guide introduces the librarian who looks after your Faculty, and shows you the key specialist resources for exploring the research in your subject.

These are generally more advanced resources than Library Search, and you'll usually receive training in using them from your librarian later in your course.

Choose your own subject guide from this list, and make a note of your librarian's name and email address.

Your librarian may run drop-in sessions—you will find information on these in your subject guide.

Finally, let's look at what the different kinds of academic work do - and what you can get out of them for your studies.

Textbooks are written specifically for students, and give a broad overview of a field. They're designed to tell you about the main areas and schools of thought in your subject, and to help you understand how it has developed.

What to use a textbook for: 

Getting started with your subject
Understanding the 'big ideas' you'll need to make sense of lectures
Quick reference for specialist terminology and key concepts

			<text>Journal articles
Journal articles are much shorter than books. However, they can still feel time-consuming to read because they are written for experts in your field - so they often use technical language and talk about specialised procedures. 

Articles generally have long and quite detailed titles that carry a lot of information!

What to use a journal article for:

Reading about recent developments in your subject
Finding data and evidence to use in your assignments
Understanding how experts in your field carry out research

			<text>Academic books &amp; journals
In this section we'll look at how academic books and journal articles are constructed.

The way that researchers and academics write can feel very different from everyday communication. Academic works often:

use specialist terms and draw on complex ideas
describe elaborate research procedures
go into a lot of detail about a very tightly defined topic.

Understanding why academic writing works this way will help you to read selectively and purposefully, and manage your learning.

Diving in 

Let's look more closely at one of those types of academic publication - a journal article.
Student reading in library
Below is an abstract - a brief description of the article, which you can generally find at the beginning of the work.
✔ Read the abstract two or three times. Can you pull out the main points of the argument?
In the present study, we analyzed data from a very large sample (N = 854,064) of players of an online game involving rapid perception, decision making, and motor responding. Use of game data allowed us to connect, for the first time, rich details of training history with measures of performance from participants engaged for a sustained amount of time in effortful practice. We showed that lawful relations exist between practice amount and subsequent performance, and between practice spacing and subsequent performance. Our methodology allowed an in situ confirmation of results long established in the experimental literature on skill acquisition. Additionally, we showed that greater initial variation in performance is linked to higher subsequent performance, a result we link to the exploration/exploitation trade-off from the computational framework of reinforcement learning. We discuss the benefits and opportunities of behavioral data sets with very large sample sizes and suggest that this approach could be particularly fecund for studies of skill acquisition.
Stafford, T.and Dewar M. (2013). Tracing the Trajectory of Skill Learning With a Very Large Sample of Online Game Players. Psychological Science 25(2), pp.511-518.
Summarise the main arguments of the article in one or two sentences, as simply as possible.

			<text>Don’t panic!
How did you get on with reading and summarising the abstract?

Many students find that it takes time to get used to academic language and ideas. If you find this, don't panic - the reason you're here is in order to develop your understanding of your subject over time, and with help from your lecturers.

People climbing an obstacle course
The research you just read about suggested that taking breaks between practice sessions is a better way to improve your skills than practising continuously. This works for studying and revising too - which is why BBC News reported on the study in non-technical language.

Now read through the BBC News report and compare the two.

Now try out your new reading strategy on a full journal article. This one's about different ways in which students learn.
Give yourself 10 minutes to read the article actively and strategically. You could set a timer on your phone or use an app. Remember, you're going to read only these sections, in this order:
Title
Abstract
First paragraph of the introduction (in this case, the first paragraph of the whole article)
Conclusions (in this case, the final paragraph before the Acknowledgements)
Graphs
Open the article and start your timer. Go!
When you've finished reading, answer these questions:
What key points does the article make? 
Will reading this article make any difference to how you study in future?
If you want to see how this research was described in the popular press, here's how it was reported by NPR.

			<text>Reading critically
Even though the books and articles on your reading lists will be written by expert researchers, your lecturers will still want you to take a critical approach to them. In this context, "being critical" doesn't mean being negative, but rather:
reading between the lines
weighing up the evidence 
taking a questioning approach.
When you read several works about the same subject, you'll find that the writers offer quite different views - sometimes they might even be contradictory. 
As you read different points of view on your subject, imagine being like a judge in a courtroom: you have to listen to the evidence, analyse what each author is saying about the topic, and work out what you think is important - and why.

			<text>Descriptive questions
Descriptive questions tend to lead to factual answers - for example, "this paper describes a study done in 2009 with a group of undergraduate students in the UK". These help you to get a grasp of the context of the work. 
If you only ask descriptive questions, you'll know what happened in the research - but you won't be able to say why it matters or whether the research could have been done better, or differently. 
The analytical questions explore how the research was done:
is it valid?
are the results reliable?
They also explore why it needed to be done - what was missing from our knowledge?
Finally, the evaluative questions make us think about the purpose and value of the research. For example:
what if the same study was done in another country: would the results be different?
what does the paper add to our knowledge of the topic?
what other research is needed in future?

Practise asking these questions on the article about note-taking.

			<text>Note making
This note making strategy will help you get the most out of the time you spend reading. It's also really helpful when you come to revise - and it's simple to do.

Divide your page in half, leaving space at the top to record what you're reading. Then: 
put everything you take from the text - e.g. quotations, paraphrases, key ideas - in the left-hand column
put everything that comes from you - your reaction to the text, what it makes you think - in the right-hand column.

Now, whenever you look at your notes, you can easily see:
everything you thought was important about this text
why you thought it was important
when and how you planned to use it.
Smart notemaking is as simple as that!</text>

			<text>Explore more
The skills you've explored in this trail - strategic reading, active notemaking, critical thinking, and academic writing - are known as 'academic literacies', and they may be the most important thing you learn at university. The ability to research, understand and present a convincing argument based on evidence is deeply important in the working world, and also in the choices we make in our everyday social lives.

We don't expect you to arrive at university already equipped with all these abilities - or to develop them in your first week, or even your first semester. You'll keep learning and developing them all the way through your degree. 
To help develop your academic literacies, have a look at the workshops and study resources offered by UEA's Learning Enhancement Team.
When you have arrived at UEA, you can also book one-to-one tutorials with Learning Enhancement Tutors.
Taking some time to reflect on your abilities and identify ways to develop further can help you do better in your studies, at every stage of your time at UEA. </text>

Explore the digital library
The Library is not just a building!
Many of the learning resources you'll use are digital. These are all specially designed academic resources bought for you by UEA Library.






You only get these while you're a student here, to make the most of them while you can!

We know you want to be able to study flexibly and read on the go, so the Library invests in ebooks and online journals to help you study wherever you are.
You can read and download our e-resources directly from Library Search.
Try this out on Library Search. Choose 'books and ebooks' from the tabbed search option and try looking for ebooks related to your course. Make a note of any interesting titles in your OneNote notebook.


Look out for lectures and workshops given by your librarian about these resources.

These will expand your understanding of how your subject is constructed and how research is communicated - and you'll write better assignments as a result!

To find a journal article try Library Search journal articles. Watch the video to see how.</text>

You can get direct access to our eresources on campus - but you can also access them from anywhere in the world by logging in with your UEA username and password. Great when you're on placement, or just when you don't want to leave your room and walk to the Library!
